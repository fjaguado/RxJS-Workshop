    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <p>
      When we declare a new Subject and we try to send a new value (in this
      case, sending a new value with the left input), the Subject will not emit
      any value. This is because, by default, <b>Subjects are lazy</b> and that
      means that they need someone to be subscribed and listen to what they are
      emitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case, when we try to send a new value with the left input, nothing
      is going to happen because we're not subscribed to the Subject. Once we
      hit the <b>Open subscriptions</b> button, we're going to be able to listen
      to what the Subject is emitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      By default,
      <b
        >Subjects don't have an initial value and don't return the current value
      </b>
      in the moment that we're subscribing to it, they are going to receive only
      values sent by the <b>next()</b> method <u>while they're subscribed</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why if we sent a value while we're not subscribed and later we
      subscribe, we're not going to receive anything until we open the
      subscription and send a new value.
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-danger" *ngIf="subject.closed">
      Subject closed! You're not able to subscribe again and you'll not receive
      any more values!

        Restart Subject
      </button>
    </div>
    <p>
      Furthermore, in this example we've subscribed three times (in different
      instances) to the same subject and we have a Close Subscriptions button
      that is going to automatically unsubscribe these three subscriptions. If
      it's needed, in other scenarios we'll be able to unsubscribe individually
      from each subscription.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last but not least, if we <u>unsubscribe from the Subject</u>, we're not
      going to be able to receive any new value sent by the Subject's next()
      method and
      <b
        >we're not going to be able to resubscribe to this Subject because we've
        already unsubscribed from it</b
      >.
