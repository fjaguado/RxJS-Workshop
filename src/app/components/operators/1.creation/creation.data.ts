      This operator is used to emit arguments as values in a sequence and then <b>complete the stream.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike <b>from</b>, it does not do any flattening or conversion and emits each argument as the same type it receives as arguments. If you pass it an Array (including array-like objects), a Promise and an iterable object it wonâ€™t be flattened into an observable sequence of values. <b>Those arguments will be emitted as the same type, i.e. an Array, a Promise or an Iterable object <u>without any conversion</u>.</b>

      Creates an Observable that emits events of a specific type coming from the given event target. 
      <ol>
        <li>
          It accepts as a first argument event target, which is an object with methods for registering event handler functions.
        </li>
        <li>
        As a second argument it takes string that indicates type of event we want to listen for.

      Every time resulting Observable is subscribed, event handler function will be registered to event target on given event type.

      fromEvent is commonly used when you need to create an Observable from a specific document event (you can use whatever Javascript exist event, it works like the addEventListener method). The only thing that you have to keep in mind is that you need to link this operator with a document ElementRef and you can do it by using the ViewChild decorator.

    <code>
    <pre>
    import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';

    const clicks = fromEvent(document, 'click');
    clicks.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
    
    // Results in:
    // MouseEvent object logged to console every time a click
    // occurs on the document.
